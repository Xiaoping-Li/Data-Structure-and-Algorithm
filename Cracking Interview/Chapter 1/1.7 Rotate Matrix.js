/*
1.7 Rotate Matrix

Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes. Write a method to rotate the image by 90
degree. Can you do this in place?

Ask questions:
1. Rotate direction: clockwise or anticlockwise?            
*/

// Brute force: create new nested array, rotate the original one, and fill the new nested array
const RotateMatrix = array => {
  const rotated = [];
  
}
