# Trees and Graphs
## Types of Trees
A tree is a data structure composed of nodes.
* Each tree has a root node.
* The root node has zero or more child nodes.
* Each child node has zero or more child nodes, and so on.###

### Trees vs. Binary Trees
* Binary tree is a tree which each node has up to two children.
* Not all trees are binary trees.  
**leaf**: A node is called a "leaf" node if it has no children.

### Binary Tree vs. Binary Search Tree
A `Binary search tree` is a _binary tree_ in which every node fits a specific ordering property: **all left descendents <= n < all right descendents**. This **must** be true for each node n.

### Balanced vs. Unbalanced
Note that balancing a tree **does not** mean the left and right subtrees are exactly the same size. Means the tree is **balanced enough** to ensure O(log n) times for _insert_ and _find_, but it's not necessarily as balanced as it could be.

Two common types of balanced trees are:
* Red-black trees
* AVL trees

### Complete Binary Trees
A `complete binary tree` is a binary tree in which every **level** of the tree is fully filled, except for perhaps the last level. To the extent that the last level is filled, it is
